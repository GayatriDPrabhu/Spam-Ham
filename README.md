# Spam-Ham
Classification as Spam or Ham 

-> Implemented multinomial Naive Bayes classifier that uses add-one Laplace smoothing to determine whether the given text is spam or ham.


-> Also, implemented the MCAP Logistic Regression algorithm with L2 regularization to do the same.


-> An attempt was made to improve both these algorithms by filtering out the stop words like 'the', of, 'for', etc.
